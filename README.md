<h3> Inspiration </h3>
As university students drowning in academic worries, we wanted to create something to help students with studying. We noticed that some of our peers prefer to study using flashcards, and we decided to create our own user-friendly flashcards app.
<br>
<h3> What it does </h3>
iQcards (a pun on IQ and cue cards) is a mobile app where users can create their own decks of double-sided flashcards to help them study and review for anything. Users can test themselves by using the test and shuffle features. Our app has a friendly minimalist and aesthetic design and also features a dark mode for the night owls. In addition, iQcards features an optional account system so users can save their decks and log in on different devices, including iQcards' desktop website.
<br>
<h3> How we built it</h3>
For this project, we created an iQcards app prototype using Figma. We also used HTML/CSS to make a demo for the iQcards website.
<br>
<h3> Challenges we ran into</h3>
Some challenges we ran into was creating and modifying the navigation bar in our mobile app prototype. Implementing the dark mode also proved to be a challenge because we had to duplicate our workspace and make sure all the transitions were correct. We also had trouble getting our demo website to display the flashcards properly.
<br>
<h3> Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>
We're really proud of creating a visually appealing mobile app prototype and doing our best in making a demo desktop site from scratch with the limited time we were given. This was one of our members' first hackathon and we're glad we were able to complete this project together.
<br>
<h3> What we learned</h3>
This was everyone's first time using Figma, so there was definitely a learning curve at the beginning. We gained a lot of UI/UX design experience as well as some front-end web development skills.

<h3>What's next for iQcards</h3>
We actually really liked the idea and concept of iQcards and we would've loved to create a fully functional mobile app, but couldn't due to the 12 hour time restriction. A goal for our team is to create an actual iQcards app and possibly launch it in the App Store. Another feature we're interested in implementing is having an 'Explore' feature, where users can browse community flashcard decks for different topics.
